# physics_games
Repo for testing small, physics based games, with education in mind. Written in python 3, using the pyglet library.


Game is found in asteroid_rage.py (working title)
Compatible with python3

Usage from terminal:
python3 asteroid_rage --width --height

width and height is the desired screen size. Note: width is currently assumed to be greater than height!
Beware that there is audio :-)
