# physics_games
Repo for testing small, physics based games, with education in mind. Written in python 3, using the pyglet library.
First attempt is asteroid_rage (working title)

#Usage from terminal:
python3 asteroid_rage --width --height



width and height is the desired screen size. Note: width is currently assumed to be greater than height!
Beware that there is audio :-)



# Controls:
w - boost, a - rotate counterclockwise,  d - rotate clockwise
